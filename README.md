5. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the datasetMerges the two datasets.

6. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors.

7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

8. The end result is shown in the file tidyset.txt.
